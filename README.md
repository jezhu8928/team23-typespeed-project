# team23-typespeed-project

Final project for SYDE121 Digital Computation, created by Anna Yang, Jessica Zhu and Tiffany Yang. The game was created in C++ and can be played in the terminal.

To play, users start by interacting with a looping menu, where they can view instructions before beginning the game. The user can enter their name to be stored in a high score file should they achieve a high score. For the gameplay, words will move across the screen, and the user is responsible for typing/entering the words they see before they reach the right edge. Points are scored depending on the colour of the word, and the user gets 5 lives (i.e. 5 words hitting the edge) before the game ends.
